# Introduction to the Foreign Function & Memory API

## Introduction


This lab introduces you to the Foreign Function & Memory API, a Preview Feature of Java 19.

Estimated Time: ~8 minutes



### **About Panama's Foreign Function & Memory API**

The Foreign Function & Memory (FFM) API, defined in JEP 424, introduces an API by which Java programs can interoperate with code and data outside of the Java runtime. The FFM API enables (1) to efficiently invoke **foreign functions** (i.e., code outside the JVM) and (2) to safely access **foreign memory** (i.e., memory not managed by the JVM). In practice, the FFM API defines classes and interfaces so that client code can

   * Allocate foreign memory (`MemorySegment`, `MemoryAddress`, and `SegmentAllocator`),
   * manipulate and access structured foreign memory (`MemoryLayout`, `VarHandle`),
   * control the allocation and deallocation of foreign memory (`MemorySession`), and
   * call foreign functions (`Linker`, `FunctionDescriptor`, and `SymbolLookup`).


### **Objectives**


In this workshop, you will:
* Get an overview of the FFM API and some of its key concepts.
* Get a brief introduction to Method Handle and Var Handle, and Preview Feature.

ðŸ’¡ This part of the workshop is theoretical as it introduces and explains some key concepts required to better understand the hands-on exercises.

## Task 1: Foreign Function & Memory API - Overview and Key Concepts

   At a high level, the steps required to invoke, from Java code, a foreign function are
   
   1. Find the target *foreign function* (in a C library)
   
   To find the target foreign function, the FFM API uses a *Linker*. A Linker is a bridge between two binary interfaces: the Java Virtual Machine and C ABIs (Application Binary Interface).
   
   2. Allocate *foreign memory*
   
   The Java client code needs to allocate, using the FFM API, the foreign memory, i.e. off-heap memory, required for proper operation of the native function.
   
   3. Obtain a method handle of the target foreign function, and invoke it

   To perform a downcall (Java code calling native code), the FFM API needs to know which native function to invoke. This is achieved with a *FunctionDescriptor* which describes the signature of the C function to invoke, i.e. its parameter types and its return type. To model those C types from Java, the FFM API uses various *MemoryLayout* objects.

   The native function will be invoked via a corresponding Method Handle. This Method Handle is created using the corresponding FunctionDescriptor.
   

ðŸ’¡ The section above describes, at a high-level, how a *downcall* (Java code calling native code) is performed but the Linker interoperates in both-direction and also enables *upcall* (native code calling Java code). Upcalls will be discussed in a later section.


## Task 2: Method Handle & Var Handle Overview

Up to this point, we have introduced new concepts introduced by Foreign Function & Memory API. The following sections will discuss existing Java SE features that are particularly relevant in the context of the FFM API, i.e. Method Handle, Var Handle, and Preview Feature.

We now should briefly discuss about Method Handle and Var Handle as they are leveraged by the FFM API. **TODO**

## Task 3: Preview Feature

Let's now discuss *preview feature* as you will be using the FFM API, a preview feature of Java 19. 

Java language features and Java SE API features have a lot of exposure, and any mistake in their design can have negative consequences. To avoid such a risk, JEP 12 offers the ability to preview new Java language and Java SE API features.

A *preview feature* is a feature that is believed to be *fully specified* and *implemented* but may still change before it is included in the Java platform on a final and permanent basis, i.e., it is *non-final*. The received feedback will be evaluated and used to make eventual adjustments *before a feature becomes permanent*.

Important *safeguards prevent developers from using non-final features accidentally*. This is necessary because a non-final feature may well be different when it becomes final and permanent in a later Java feature release. Moreover, only final, permanent features are subject to Java's stringent backward-compatibility rules.

Therefore, to avoid unintentional use, preview features are *disabled by default*, and the JDK documentation unequivocally warns you about the non-final nature of these features and any of their associated APIs.

Preview features are also specific to a given Java SE feature release and require the use of special flags at *compile time* as well as at *runtime*.


```java
// compile time
javac --enable-preview --release 19 MyClass.java
```

```java
// runtime
java --enable-preview MyClass
```
This workshop requires those flags to be set as the FFM API is a preview feature of Java 19. If you don't, you will get an error informing you that you are trying to use preview features and that you need to explicitly enable those.

```text
> javac MyClass.java
MyClass.java:42: error: ofPlatform() is a preview API and is disabled by default.
		var pthread = Thread.ofPlatform()
		                    ^
  (use --enable-preview to enable preview APIs)
1 error
```

ðŸ’¡ Since Java 11 and JEP 330 (Launch Single-File Source-Code Programs), it is possible to compile and run a class in one single command. This is also possible with a class that is using a preview feature.

```java
// compile *and* run MyClass.java
java --enable-preview --source 19 MyClass.java
```

## Task 4: Enable Native Access

The FFM API has been designed with safety in mind, part of it, however, is inherently unsafe. This is fundamentally due to the fact that Java code might invoke an unsafe native method, and obviously, the Java Virtual Machine has no control over what happens on the foreign side. For that reason, the JVM will issue a warning at run time when a native call is invoked.

```text
...
WARNING: A restricted method in java.lang.foreign.Linker has been called
WARNING: java.lang.foreign.Linker::nativeLinker has been called by the unnamed module
WARNING: Use --enable-native-access=ALL-UNNAMED to avoid a warning for this module
...
```

Such a warning can be disabled with the `--enable-native-access=M` flag on the java command line. This flag disables warning when some native code is invoked from the specified module(s). In addition, when that flag is set, an `IllegalCallerException` will be thrown when any unspecified module(s) is trying to perform a native invocation.
