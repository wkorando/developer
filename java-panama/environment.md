# Your workshop environment

## Introduction

This lab introduces you to the workshop environement.

Estimated Time: ~10 minutes

### **Objectives**

In this lab, you will:
* Discover OCI Cloud Shell and Cloud Editor.
* Do some minimal setup to prepare your environment.

## Task 1: Cloud Shell

To perform this workshop, you will use Java 19 on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. In theory, you can also do it the workshop our own machine with Java 19 installed but in the interest of time, it is easier to use OCI. 

Cloud Shell is a browser-based terminal that provides an ephemeral Linux machine. Cloud Shell simplifies working with cloud resources on OCI. Under the hood, Cloud Shell uses an OCI pre-configured Virtual Machine with preinstalled tools, including Java. And as you will see in this workshop, Cloud Shell can also be used to develop simple applications.


To launch Cloud Shell, simply log on the OCI console via [cloud.oracle.com](https://cloud.oracle.com), and click the Cloud Shell icon on the top right.

After 20~30 seconds, your Cloud Shell VM will be up and running, and your Cloud Shell terminal will be displayed in your browser.

You now can use Cloud Shell as a regular shell.

## Task 2: Prepare your environment

This workshop uses Java 19 which was released in September 2022. And although Cloud Shell supports Java, it doesn't come yet with Java 19 support. So you will now install Java 19. And don't worry, this is easy.

You first need to clone the workshop repository to get all workshop material.


```text
<copy>git clone TODO</copy>
```

You can now install and setup Java 19 with the following commands.


```text
<copy>cd TODO ‚ö†Ô∏è
source scripts/TODO.sh</copy>
```

This script downloads and untars Java 19, and configures the JAVA_HOME environment variable properly. You can confirm that Java 19 is installed with the command below.

```text
<copy>java -version</copy>
```

And last but not least, you should build the artifacts required for the workshop.

```text
<copy>cd ~
./scripts/generate_stdlib_partial.sh stdio
./scripts/generate_stdlib_partial.sh dirent
mvn clean package
</copy>
```

‚ö†Ô∏è TODO
- git clone, install java19 + Java-home
- setup-ce !!! this script need to change bascrc to set JAVA_HOME and avoid csruntime issue!!



## Task 3: Cloud Editor


During the workshop, you will also also use Cloud Editor, a Cloud Shell feature that offers a browser-based modern text editor.

To launch Cloud Editor, simply click, in the [OCI console](https://cloud.oracle.com), on the Cloud Editor icon on the top right, next to the Cloud Shell icon.

  ![Starting Cloud Editor](../images/ce-start.png)
  
üí° Cloud Editor runs in the Cloud Shell VM but you don't have to start Cloud Shell to use Cloud Editor. If you don't, the Cloud Shell VM will automatically be started when Cloud Editor is launched.


  ![Cloud Editor default layout](../images/cs-ce-horizontal.png)

By default, Cloud Shell and Cloud Editor use a stacked layout. You can adjust this layout to fit your preferences by clicking on the top-left "View" option.

You can also re-size, maximize, minimize, swap, close the Cloud Shell and/or the Cloud Editor window, change fonts (check the "Gear" icon). You can also open Cloud Shell and Cloud Editor in different browser windows/tabs, etc. We suggest spending 1 or 2 minutes getting familiar with both Cloud Shell and Cloud Editor.

üí° For the workshop, we suggest keeping both Cloud Shell and Cloud Editor open in the same window, and the workshop guide in a different browser window/tab.

üí° As mentioned earlier Cloud Shell doesn't come yet with Java 19 support. For this workshop, Cloud Editor has been set up to support Java 19.

Congratulations, you are now all set for the next step!
