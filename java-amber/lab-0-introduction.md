# Introduction

## About this Workshop

Project Amber is an OpenJDK project that continuously improves Java's expressiveness and programming model with smaller, productivity-oriented language features.
So far, it has delivered:

* local-variable type inference with var (in Java 10)
* switch expressions (in Java 14)
* text blocks (in Java 15)
* type pattern matching (in Java 16)
* records (in Java 16)
* sealed types (in Java 17)

And it is working on more features, some of them in preview in Java 19:

* pattern matching in `switch`
* record patterns

The goal of this workshop is to introduce you to the new language features that Project Amber introduced and is previewing.

Estimated Workshop Time: ~TODO minutes
